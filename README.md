This is a work for a college where our class must develop a Human Resources system, and since we're from Brazil, 
you might see portuguese code and comments. There will be 12 people working in this project, and only 2 of them know 
how to program in C# (We'll use ASP.NET Webforms) and 6 will be learning how to. (8 people will program,the others will do something else, equally important). Each person will be responsible of something
in the system, and there will be people who won't program at all, they'll prepare the documentation, test, 
and manage the project.

*Our purpose is to simulate a software company* (although many of us do work in real software companies).

Everyone will do some analysis work before start programming.
